# Digit-Recognition

## Introduction:

To construct the Android application, I harnessed the power of the Flutter framework, a versatile toolkit developed by Google. Employing the Flutter-tflite package facilitated the integration of a deep learning methodology, enabling seamless incorporation of machine learning models. For text-to-voice functionality, I leveraged the Flutter-tts package, enriching the user experience with voice-based interactions. The implementation of handwriting recognition involved the adept use of the GestureDetector class and CustomPaint class. Through these components, user input from the touch-screen is converted into an image, subsequently processed by a pre-existing model, and the results are visually presented to the user.
