# Digit-Recognition-with-tflite
## Introduction:

For building an Android app I used the Flutter framework which was built by Google. To implement the deep learning method use the flutter-tflite package, converting text to voice I used the flutter-tts package. To record the handwritten I used GestureDetector class and CustomPaint class. We take input from the touch-screen and convert it to an image then show the result using a previously built model.
