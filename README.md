# Digit-Recognition-with-tflite
## Introduction:
People's reliance on machines is increasing day by day. People are nowadays dependent on machine learning and deep learning. By using deep learning a lot of critical problems were solved like classification of image, voice recognition, object detection, and many others. In this paper, we will work on ”Handwritten Digit Recognition”. It’s also known as handwritten text recognition, which is the ability of a computer to receive and interest intelligible handwritten input from source search as paper documents, photographs, touch-screens. We will build a mobile app that can do by taking handwritten from a touch screen and classify it between 0-9.

## Mobile App:
For building an Android app we used the Flutter framework which was built by Google. To implement the deep learning method use the flutter-tflite package, converting text to voice we use the flutter-tts package. To record the handwritten we use GestureDetector class and CustomPaint class. We take input from the touch-screen and convert it to an image then show the result using a previously built model.
